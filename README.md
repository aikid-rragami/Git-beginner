# Github for Beginners (like myself)
My first repository and I want it to focus on tips and skills needed for a beginner in Data Science

I can only speak for myself when it comes to mainly the daunting level of skill and knowledge needed to work in any industry in tech, but primarily in the field of Data Science. Admittedly the amount required to cover the subject entirely would be virtually impossible without at least breaking the issue down a bit further into smaller piecesâ€”for example, the foundations needed to make Machine Learning models make some predictions for us. Understanding the data itself takes not only Computer Science knowledge but also knowledge in Mathematics. 

I come from a foundational coding background. I used my degree in Mathematics to use particular codes to carry out specific tasks in maths, like integrating or doing some Linear Algebra operations. I want this repository to include topics for people in similar positions to look into and for the information for aspiring data scientists to be slightly easier.

Again, this is my first repository, and I have a lot to learn about Git to achieve that. But, for now, here it is, a repository for the first time!!!!!

# What you will see in this repository
You will find files in here with a bunch of different stuff as I learn how to use this platform better. Most of my time up till recently has been spent using the Kaggle platform and making use of the free classes there to develop my knowledge on Machine Learning. Their UI was extremely friendly and they also make the learning process much easier.
